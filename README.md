# GoTypo
GoTypo – A fast and lightweight spellchecker written in Go.
# What is GoTypo?

GoTypo is a simple yet effective spellchecker built in Go. It uses:

  - Trie for fast word lookup
  - Levenshtein Distance to detect typos
  - A basic Markov Model for smarter suggestions

If you've ever mistyped something and wished for a quick fix, GoTypo has your back.
# Why Go?

  - Fast – No sluggish scripts, just raw performance.
  - Lightweight – No bloated dependencies, runs as a single binary.
  - Cross-platform – Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

# Installation (Coming soon!)

Once the project is in a working state, you'll be able to install it with:
```bash
go install github.com/yourusername/gotypo@latest
```
For now, you can clone the repo and run it manually:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gotypo.git
cd gotypo
go run main.go
```
# How It Works (Planned Features)

  - Real-time spellchecking from input text
  - CLI-based interface for quick corrections
  - Custom word lists for better accuracy
  - Basic GUI support (maybe?)
